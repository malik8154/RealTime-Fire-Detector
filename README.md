A real-time fire detection system using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. The system detects fire instantly from live camera feeds, triggers alerts, and logs fire events automatically.

---

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: Detects fire instantly from webcam or IP camera feeds.  
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works with laptop webcams and Android phone cameras.  
- **Event Logging**: Automatically logs fire detection events in `fire_alerts.log`.  
- **Audio Alerts**: Triggers an audible alarm when fire is detected.  
- **Lightweight Model**: Trained CNN model optimized for fast inference.

## üì• Download the Trained Model

The trained CNN model for real-time fire detection can be downloaded here:

[Download models.rar](https://github.com/malik8154/RealTime-Fire-Detector/releases/download/v1.0/models.rar)

> Extract the `.rar` file to get `forest_fire_cnn.h5` before running `fire_detection.py`.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Tips

* Any small flame (candle, lighter, or fire video) can be used for testing.
* No need to demonstrate an actual forest fire.
* Ensure **good lighting** and **camera clarity** for accurate detection.
* Recommended for **educational, safety simulation, or prototyping purposes**.
